# Project-13
# Coding Challenge Practice Repository

This repository is a collection of solutions and notes from coding challenges on popular online platforms. The primary focus is on three main websites: LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeWars. Each of these platforms offers unique benefits for honing programming and problem-solving skills.

## LeetCode

LeetCode is renowned for its extensive array of coding challenges covering a broad spectrum of topics, including algorithms, data structures, databases, and more. Key benefits include:

- **Technical Interview Preparation:** LeetCode problems are often similar to those encountered in technical interviews, making it an excellent resource for interview preparation.
- **Diverse Problem Set:** Challenges are categorized by difficulty and topic, providing a diverse set of problems for users to tackle.

## HackerRank

HackerRank is a versatile platform that offers challenges in various domains, such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, databases, and more. Its benefits include:

- **Hiring Assessments:** Many companies use HackerRank to create coding assessments for hiring purposes, allowing users to practice and showcase their skills to potential employers.
- **Skill Domains:** Challenges cover a wide range of skill domains, making it suitable for both competitive programming enthusiasts and those looking to specialize in specific areas.

## CodeWars

CodeWars takes a unique approach with its focus on "kata," small coding challenges that users solve and discuss with others. Key benefits include:

- **Learning Through Others:** Users can discuss and compare solutions with a diverse community, fostering collaboration and learning from different perspectives.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** CodeWars uses a "kyu" system, progressing from easier to more challenging problems, providing a structured learning path.
